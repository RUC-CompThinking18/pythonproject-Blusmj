# Comments
Your commenting here wasn't as strong as it could have been: remember that we're looking for the why, not just the what. You gave some of that, but your comments tended to fall away as the program went on.
# Code Quality
I'll say that the experience of running the program was generally good: you had a lot of material and text. Sometimes it wasn't clear what I was supposed to type in in order to get it to keep running, but, overall, it was a nice little interactive short story.

The code could have been better encapsulated: a big series of nested if-statements is not going to be as easy to maintain or expand as using functions to replicate code.
# Ambition
I'll say that this feels fairly ambitious: you had a lot of text, and you managed to get pretty far in your scenario. The writing could have been revised a bit more for clarity, but as I said above, you managed to create a nice little adventure scenario.
