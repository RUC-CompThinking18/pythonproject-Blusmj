My project was a kind of text adventure/ Text story. I wanted to give a small
story with some choices that can change the outcome of the story, such as whether
you live or die during it. I chose this because games are something i'm interested in
and I have a interest in games with choices. I find them fun and I like
seeing outcomes with choices you made. I chose the setting I did because I like fantasy
-type settings, and I chose a slime because at the time of the project I was watching
a show about a character that got turned into a slime. It was a fun show and made me
wonder how it would actually be like being in a body like that.

I wasn't able to do some of the stuff I wanted to, like drawing pictures going with the code
to make it a more fun project to look at. However, I ran out of time and couldn't get around to it.
I struggled with indenting and ran into millions of problems with using them. And also I had trouble condensing
code because the codes I tried felt like they never worked, when I tried to implement them.
I also had more decisions but as I went on I realized how convoluted and kind of a mess my code was
when I started the fight with the bear, as I wasn't sure how to make it more efficient.
I also had trouble with thinking of how to go about the story or if I should even think of sticking
with the same story. During writing the code I realized I wasn't much of a writer so I didn't know
if I should have stuck with it. But I think it came out decently in the end...at least for the small choices I guess.
I also ended up turning it late because I made the mistake of not saving constantly
and wrote most of the story until my laptop decided to crash. So yeah, that was my fault as well and I
definitely learned that I need to save constantly next time.
