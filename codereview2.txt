The code runs, which was the major requirement for this code review, and using time.sleep to space out the prompts is a nice touch. Looking at the grading requirements we discussed in class yesterday, I'll say that I recommend you focus on making the game a bit more robust, since right now you have an intro but no content past that. I'll also say that you should consider looking for ways to encapsulate this code a bit more to avoid repeating yourself: what function could you write to be called at various points to prevent yourself having to retype the code at the end under the "ch1" variable?
